## Data

The project utilized a dataset with (mention the number) records, including customer information, call records, plan details, and churn labels.

## Data Preparation

Data was cleaned by removing duplicates, handling outliers, and addressing null values.

## Data Visualizations

Python and Power BI were employed to create data visualizations for insights.

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis included data distributions, central tendency, and hypothesis testing using z-scores.

## Auto EDA

Automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted using tools such as Pandas Profiling, Auto Viz, Sweet Viz, and the Atoti Library.

## Model Training

Machine learning models were trained on 80% of the dataset.

## Model Testing

Model performance was evaluated on the remaining 20% of the dataset.

## Cross-Validation

K-fold cross-validation was used to assess model robustness.

## Model Accuracy Comparison

Models were compared, and accuracy was visualized for selection.

## Finalized Model

The best-performing model, including its specifications, was chosen.

## Deployment

The model was deployed as a Flask web application for real-time predictions.
